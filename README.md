LastingSales is a CRM that simplifies the business by providing a centralized platform to manage Leads from Facebook, Website and Sales Calls and helps to track and measure the Sales Team Performance.

== Description ==
LastingSales connects to [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) to give you instant alerts of new leads, so you can get in touch with them via WhatsApp, SMS, iMessage, or phone call within seconds.

It also offers auto-personalised messages and content, trackable PDF files and pages, automatic follow up reminders, and many more features to help you manage your leads and increase sales conversion.

All of this can be done easily from your phone via our mobile app, which works with WhatsApp, SMS, email, and other popular chat apps.

In addition to WordPress Contact Form 7, LastingSales can also integrate with other lead sources such as [Facebook Lead Ads](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/lead-ads), [Google Ad Lead Forms Extensions](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9423234?hl=en), [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), and other website contact forms.
